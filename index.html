                  Like any other Learning Institution, here at Kalax Cyber World we provide the <b>best learning courses</b> for anyone to begin their technological journey. We let - ofcourse with supervision, the learner set not only his/her pase but also the time favourable for the learner. We are all about hands-on <b>practicals</b> where the learners use - according to our <b>Rules and Regulations,</b> one computer per student.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By teaching the students in a hands-on approach, the students have a better chance of fully interracting with the computers and build their muscle memory. To better increase the students' muscle, there are practical tests done at regular intervals to smoothen the transition of students.
                  <br>
                  <p>The Courses offered are basically on Computer Packages which are:-
                    <ul>
                      <code>
                        <li>Microsoft Word</li>
                        <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
                        <li>Microsoft Access</li>
